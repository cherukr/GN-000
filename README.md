# ![gn-000](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cherukr-github/gn-000-github.png) Gundam: v.GN-000 

***note: I'm a huge nerd and gundam has always been one my most favorite anime franchises***

A lot of my apps use a similar base set of services, so this repo will serve as my starter repo for new projects.

What will this consist of?

Tech (./lib): 
  * linuxbrew
  * Java
  * Scala
  * Clojure
  * Python (Anaconda Distribution)
  * Cassandra
  * Elasticsearch
  * Kibana
  * Logstash
  * Titan
  * Spark
  * Storm
  * Netflix OSS:
    * Ribbon
    * Eureka
    * Hystrix
  * Mesos
  * Docker
  * Vagrant

Services (./src): This base repo will have some basic services to serve as a typical roadmap

Recipes (./recipes): The repo will include recipes to start a singleton instance (vagrant), a partially-clustered instance (docker), and a fully clustered instance (mesos+docker).
